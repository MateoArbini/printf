# Our own Printf Function 
The objective of this project is to make our own **printf function( printf("Hello World\n"); )** that can be found on the **<stdio.h> Library**. To achieve our goal we run our function under the conditions of multiple arguments **(va_args)** due to not knowing beforehand, how many parameters we are receiving, **Va_args** belongs **<stdarg.h> Library**.
````c
int printf ( const char * format, ... );
````
